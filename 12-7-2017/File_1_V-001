//Objective = To Create An Entity: Player, With 3-Dimensional In A 2-Dimensional Enviroment.


The 3-Dimensional Theory


E.g: /
// Assume This Is A 3-Dimensional Cube With 1 x 1 x 1

The Cube Is = 1 x 1 x 1


If You Apply This In Your Any Entity Making,
 The Entity Can Be A 3-Dimensional Looking Character.
 
 //Note: Do Not Put A Limit In The Entity, IF Your Entity Can Wear An Additional ( Items ).
 
 TO Make Use Of This, You Need To Over-Lay The Entity ( skin ).
 
 Example:
  Your Enity Must Have Atleast 3 or more layer
  first layer: the simply design ( the skeleton )
  second layer: the design ( the flesh ) // I really put it there
  third layer: the additional ( the skin )
  
  Thus You Need To Over-Lay
   3rd Layer > 2nd Layer > 1st Layer
   
   // Note : Seperate The Whole Body To Specify Categories
    Eg.
     Head
     Body
     Arm Left 
     Arm Right
     Leg Left
     Leg Right
     
     Like That..
